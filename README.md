## ðŸ’¾ Step by step

For this project, I first looked at the courses in javascript to familiarize myself with the logic of this language. I was able to achieve this thanks to the many resources on the web. The small challenges helped me understand how fetch works to retrieve data from an API.

In designing my website, I put the emphasis on accessibility. It seemed important to me to make my site accessible to as many people as possible.

I was also able to pay attention to the use of certain libraries which are sometimes vulnerable and which can reduce the performance of the site.

I was made aware of the different elements of the CRUD (Create, read, Update, Delete), how this is processed by the server, how to handle the data. And all this asynchronously thanks to fetch (a powerful tool).

I made sure my code was maintainable and understandable in the long run. This is the reason why I made several files and each functionality has been described inside a function.

With this project, I also learned what an id was, to maintain data in the localStorage to save it, to reuse it. I could see that javascript is a powerful tool for setting up a dynamic display.

For that I used if conditions, for loops, it was also necessary to use arrays in order to contain the data. This project gave me a lot of knowledge and was one of the most fascinating that I have been able to do. A real pleasure !

## ðŸ”Œ Points to improve

I would like to have the chance to reproduce one by myself but with a database and frameworks such as React. My biggest difficulty was the implementation of the increment at the level of the basket. I hope I can improve myself and master all of this!
